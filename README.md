# SoundCloud-2

SoundCloud-2 is a full-stack clone of the music and audio-sharing app SoundCloud, where users can upload, edit, and stream music, and comment on other users' songs. 

A large portion of the project was completed over a 10-day timeframe, with new features and improvements added over time. 

SoundCloud-2 makes use of a Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL backend, with React.js and Redux on the frontend.
